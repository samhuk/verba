# Transports

This is the build-in Transports of Verba. There are two:

* `consoleTransport` - Prints to `process.stdout`, i.e. what `console.log` prints to.
* `fileTransport` - Prints to a given file, defined by a stream or a file path.

These accept a variety of options that customize how they behave, such as formatting and batching.
