3. From the root directory of your new local clone, run `node setup.js`, entering in some details.
4. After it completes, you can remove `setup.js` and this section of the README.
5. For information on how to develop on your new codebase, see [./contributing/development.md](./contributing/development.md)
6. Have fun!

This template is approximately based off of [ts-pg-orm](https://github.com/samhuk/ts-pg-orm). Therefore, feel free to take a look at that to see how this template can be expanded upon.

### Side-Note About Integration Test Configuration
Integration test configuration exists for this template. These are sometimes, but not always, necessary. If your package will not need them, then do the following:
* Remove the scripts related to integration tests from `package.json`.
* Remove the `integration-tests` environment configuration from `.env-cmdrc.json`.
* Remove the integration test content from `contributing/development.md`.
